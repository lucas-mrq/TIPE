## TIPE
After spending the first year of preparatory class working on the aspects of particle displacement from a physical point of view, in the 2nd year I tried the computer side. So I did these 3 different sub-projects.

<!-- Program Virtual_Lake -->
## Program Virtual_Lake
In this first project I simply tried to simulate the movement of particles in a square with currents forming a kind of syphon. The objective is to see if the movement of the particles works.

<!-- Program Leman Lake -->
## Program Leman Lake
For this project I started with a map of Lake Geneva with the currents, which I entered into a table manually. Then using the functions of the first program I dropped several particles into the lake and created several images to visualize the displacements.
<ol>
    <li>Initial placement of the particles</a></li>
    <li>Beaches with the most stranded particles</a></li>
    <li>Particle placement after a few moves</a></li>
    <li>Superposition of the movement of all particles (stranded particles are in red)</a></li>
    <li>Displacement of a non-grounded particle</a></li>
    <li>Displacement of a particle having left the lake</a></li>
</ol>

## Program Groix_Island
For my last programme, the main objective was to automate everything. So for the first time I tackled image processing. Using an image from a database (https://data.shom.fr/), I wanted to model the movement of particles in the ocean. This gave me an image like the one below. The displacement seems very geometric but the idea was in the long run to superimpose several maps and create a large displacement map of micro-particles.
